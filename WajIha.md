## What I have learnt in this course of Computing For Bioinformatics.


**I have learnt using github and doing different tasks in it.like**
 
 * Making new repositories in the gihubüòÑ
 
 *  A repository is what,how do it works.
 
 * Creating my own codespace.‚ò∫Ô∏è
  
 * Checking the mechanism of autograding in github and its workflow.
 
 * Making commits onto github
 
 * How to push your code into github.
 
 * About pull requests. 
 
 
## WHAT ARE MY CONFUSIONS THAT NEED TO GET SORTED OUT.


* I have learnt the basic concepts so far,but i will get stuck doin more complex one.and i am confused about githhub autograding system,like the criteria on the basis of which it checks the code,we need to use same  function name as you have used in your test files,or same variable name to make it work or we can give any name to our function and variable and so on.üò¨
  
* Secondly,I don't understand pseudocode,and i find it difficult building logic behind the problem.

 ## What I liked or didn‚Äôt like about the content of this course.

* Firstly i didn't like how github works,but now since i am learning it so i have astarted liking it aswell.
* It is a good thing that we are given tasks,its sorta hectic but atleast we are learning things.Its better having hectic routinue then learning nothing.
* So yeah its been good so far.Juat don't ask for pseudocodes or logics behind codes,but i guess we need more practice of it.

##  Would like to see more of? What would be interesting or helpful to my learning journey?
* More of practice work on building logics for problems.
