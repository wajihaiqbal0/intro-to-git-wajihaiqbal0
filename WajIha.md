# WHAT ARE MY CONFUSIONS THAT NEED TO GET SORTED OUT.


I have learnt the basic concepts so far,but i will get stuck doin more complex one.and i am confused about githhub autograding system,like the criteria on the basis of which it checks the code,we need to use same  function name as you have used in your test files,or same variable name to make it work or we can give any name to our function and variable and so on.üò¨
